Need a few endpoints
- Creat Game endpoint : creates a new game and adds it to DB. 
    - Creates a new entry in the DB (gameId, snapshot, createTime)
    - This returns a gameId and createTime
- Post Game endpoint : adds a stack of actions to a game
    - actions are ordered, need to create actionId, all are added to DB
    - game info updated to include a lastUpdated Property
- Get Game endpoint : returns the entire game object 
    - takes in a gameId, returns the entire object associated with that game
